                            Carley Fortune's debut novel, "Every Summer After," is a poignant and beautifully crafted exploration of family, friendship, and the transformative power of summer. Set against the backdrop of a picturesque lakeside community, Fortune weaves together the stories of three childhood friends who reunite after years apart, each grappling with their own personal struggles and longing for connection.

The novel follows the lives of Alex, Hayden, and Cass, who were inseparable as children but drifted apart as they grew older. When tragedy strikes, they are drawn back to their hometown of Lake Waseka, where they must confront unresolved feelings and navigate the complexities of adulthood.

One of the novel's greatest strengths is its richly drawn characters, each grappling with their own demons and yearning for a sense of belonging. From Alex, the ambitious journalist haunted by her past, to Hayden, the struggling musician searching for purpose, and Cass, the free-spirited artist hiding her insecurities, Fortune imbues her protagonists with depth and authenticity.

Fortune's evocative prose captures the essence of small-town life, from the sun-drenched days spent lounging by the lake to the intimate gatherings around bonfires and barbecues. Through vivid descriptions and sensory detail, she transports readers to the idyllic setting of Lake Waseka, inviting them to immerse themselves in its beauty and charm.

At its core, "Every Summer After" is a story about the power of friendship to heal old wounds and the importance of embracing change. As Alex, Hayden, and Cass navigate the ups and downs of their reunion, they are forced to confront difficult truths about themselves and each other, ultimately discovering that true strength lies in vulnerability and connection.

While the novel deals with weighty themes such as grief, forgiveness, and self-discovery, Fortune infuses the narrative with moments of warmth and humor, creating a story that is both heartwrenching and uplifting. Through its compelling characters and poignant storytelling, "Every Summer After" is a testament to the enduring bonds of friendship and the enduring power of love to heal and transform.

                            "Clear: A Novel" by Carys Davies is a mesmerizing literary journey that transports readers to the rugged landscapes of the American West while exploring themes of loss, redemption, and the quest for meaning in an ever-changing world.

At the heart of the story is the enigmatic protagonist, Solomon, a widowed astronomer haunted by the memory of his deceased wife and the secrets she left behind. Determined to uncover the truth about her past, Solomon embarks on a perilous journey across the untamed wilderness of nineteenth-century America, accompanied only by his faithful horse, Cleopatra, and a mysterious young boy named Burt.

As Solomon traverses vast expanses of desert and mountainous terrain, he encounters a diverse cast of characters, each with their own stories of hardship and resilience. From the stoic Native American tracker, to the eccentric inventor obsessed with capturing images of the heavens, Davies skillfully weaves together their disparate narratives, creating a tapestry of human experience that is at once captivating and profound.

But it is Solomon's internal journey that lies at the heart of "Clear," as he grapples with grief, regret, and the overwhelming desire to find meaning in a world that often seems indifferent to his struggles. Through Davies' lyrical prose and keen insight into the human psyche, readers are drawn into Solomon's quest for redemption, rooting for him as he confronts his demons and seeks solace in the beauty of the natural world.

With its evocative imagery, richly drawn characters, and thought-provoking exploration of timeless themes, "Clear: A Novel" is a masterful work of fiction that lingers in the mind long after the final page is turned. Davies' ability to evoke the harsh beauty of the American frontier and the complexities of the human spirit is nothing short of breathtaking, making "Clear" a must-read for lovers of literary fiction and historical adventure alike.

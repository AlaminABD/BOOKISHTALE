                            "Expiration Dates: A Novel" by Rebecca Serle is a thought-provoking exploration of love, loss, and the complexities of human connection in the face of mortality. Set in a world where everyone knows the exact date of their death, the novel follows the lives of two strangers, Harper and Tom, whose paths intersect in unexpected ways as they grapple with the implications of their expiration dates.

At the heart of the story is Harper, a young woman who has always lived her life according to the numbers, meticulously planning each moment in anticipation of her predetermined expiration date. But when she meets Tom, a man who challenges her beliefs and forces her to confront the uncertainty of the future, Harper begins to question everything she thought she knew about love and destiny.

Serle's writing is both poignant and lyrical, drawing readers into a world that is at once familiar and yet eerily different from our own. Through Harper and Tom's journey, she explores timeless themes of fate, free will, and the power of human connection to transcend the boundaries of time.

As Harper and Tom navigate the ups and downs of their relationship, they must confront their deepest fears and insecurities, learning to embrace the beauty of the present moment and the infinite possibilities that lie ahead. Along the way, they discover that true love knows no bounds and that sometimes, the most meaningful moments are the ones that defy all expectations.

"Expiration Dates" is a captivating and emotionally resonant novel that will leave readers questioning the nature of fate and the choices that shape our lives. Serle's masterful storytelling and rich character development make this book a must-read for anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of love, life, and what it means to truly live in the moment.

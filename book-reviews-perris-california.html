At the center of the story is the Montgomery family, whose members grapple with their own demons while navigating the challenges of love, loss, and redemption. As patriarch Jack Montgomery battles with addiction and past traumas, his wife, Sarah, struggles to hold their family together in the face of adversity. Meanwhile, their children, Emily and Michael, confront their own personal demons as they strive to carve out their own paths in life.

From Percy's sassy sidekick, a wisecracking ghost named Morty, to the dashing Reaper with a heart of gold, each character adds depth and dimension to the story, contributing to its rich tapestry of humor and hijinks.
                            
                            Yet, amidst the laughter and levity, "Your Coffin or Mine" also offers moments of genuine emotion and insight. Hyde deftly explores themes of love, loss, and the search for meaning in a world that defies comprehension, imbuing the story with a surprising amount of heart and depth beneath its zany exterior.
